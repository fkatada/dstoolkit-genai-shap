Further, the Company\u2019s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holidaydemand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product\nintroductions can also impact the Company\u2019s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a productlaunch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers\nand distributors anticipate a product introduction.\nFiscal Period\nThe Company\u2019s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter\nevery five or six years to realign the Company\u2019s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023.

Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based oncertain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regardingthe potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking\nstatements can also be identified by words such as \u201cfuture,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cpredicts,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cwould,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d\u201ccan,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company\u2019s actual results may differ significantly\nfrom the results discussed in the forward-looking statements.

This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and governance\nmatters, and details related to the Company\u2019s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is notincorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company\u2019s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holidaydemand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product\nintroductions can also impact the Company\u2019s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a productlaunch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers\nand distributors anticipate a product introduction.\nFiscal Period\nThe Company\u2019s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter\nevery five or six years to realign the Company\u2019s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company\u2019s fiscal years2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively.\nQuarterly Highlights\nTotal net sales decreased 5% or $6.8 billion during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currenciesrelative to the U.S. dollar. The weakness in foreign currencies contributed to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, which was partially offset by higher net sales of\niPad.\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, the Company announced a new iPad, a new iPad Pro powered by the Apple M2 chip, and a new Apple TV 4K.\nThe Company repurchased $19.0 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.8 billion during the first quarter of 2023.\n\u00ae\nApple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 15"

On September 10,2021, the District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic\u2019s claim. The District Court found that certain\nprovisions of the Company\u2019s App Store Review Guidelines violate California\u2019s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company fromprohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing.

On April 24, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the \u201cCircuitCourt\u201d) affirmed the District Court\u2019s ruling.

European Commission State Aid Decision: The European Commission issued a decision that Ireland granted state aid to Apple by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two Apple subsidiaries. The decision ordered Ireland to recover additional taxes from Apple for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Both Apple and Ireland appealed the decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union, which annulled the decision. The European Commission appealed the annulment to the European Court of Justice, and a hearing was held with a decision expected in calendar year 2024.\n\nThese legal proceedings and contingencies could potentially impact Apple in several ways:\n\n- The Epic Games lawsuit could lead to changes in Apple's App Store policies and practices, particularly regarding the prohibition of developers from including external links to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. If the injunction takes effect, it could impact Apple's App Store revenue and operating model.\n- The European Commission State Aid Decision could result in Apple being required to pay additional taxes for the specified period if the appeal by the European Commission is successful. Apple believes it would be eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the decision.\n\nBoth matters could have financial implications for Apple, including potential monetary liabilities and changes to business practices that could affect future revenue and profitability.\n\nSOURCE(S): 2022 Q3 AAPL.pdf, 2023 Q1 AAPL.pdf, 2023 Q2 AAPL.pdf, 2023 Q3 AAPL.pdf",

The decrease in our effective tax rate for the current quarter compared to the prior year was primarily due to tax benefits from tax law changes in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, including the impact from the issuance of Notice 2023-55 by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and U.S. Treasury Department, which delayed the effective date of final foreign tax credit regulations to fiscal year 2024 for Microsoft.\nOur effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nWe remain under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017. With respect to the audit for tax years 2004 to 2013, on September 26, 2023, we received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (\u201cNOPAs\u201d) from the IRS. The primary issues in the NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 billion plus penalties and interest. As of September 30, 2023, we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will vigorously contest the NOPAs through the IRS\u2019s administrative appeals office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our income tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2023, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as dividends, share repurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and the transition tax related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTCJA\u201d), for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments\nCash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $144.0 billion and $111.3 billion as of September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively. Equity investments were $11.4 billion and $9.9 billion as of September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.\n37",

In February 2012, the IRSwithdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of theexamination.

We hire a mix of university and industry talentworldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one\u2019s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.\nOur devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers, some of which contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. For these components, we have limited near-term flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. Extended disruptions at these suppliers and\/or manufacturers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2023. \nOn January 18, 2023, we announced decisions we made to align our cost structure with our revenue and customer demand, prioritize our investments in strategic areas, and consolidate office space. As a result, we recorded a $1.2 billion charge in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 (\u201cQ2 charge\u201d), which included employee severance expenses of $800 million, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. First, we reduced our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, which represents less than 5% of our total employee base. While we eliminated roles in some areas, we will continue to hire in key strategic areas. Second, we are allocating both our capital and talent to areas of secular growth and long-term competitiveness, while divesting in other areas. Third, we are consolidating our leases to create higher density across our workspaces, which will also impact our financial results through the remainder of fiscal year 2023, and we may make similar decisions in future periods as we continue to evaluate our real estate needs. \nRefer to Risk Factors (Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\nSeasonality\nOur revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year.

The sequential decrease was influenced by fixed asset write-downs in the prior quarter.",
        "reference":"Yes, there has been a considerable shift in NVIDIA's operating costs over the reported quarters. The main causes for this shift include:\n\n1. Acquisition Termination Cost: In the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, NVIDIA recorded an acquisition termination cost of $1.35 billion due to the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired Arm Limited from SoftBank. This one-time cost significantly impacted operating expenses for that period.\n\n2. Stock-Based Compensation Expense: NVIDIA has experienced increases in stock-based compensation expenses, which are a part of operating expenses. For example, the stock-based compensation expense was $745 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, and it increased to $979 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024.\n\n3. Research and Development: There has been an increase in research and development expenses, which is a key component of operating expenses. For instance, research and development expenses were $1,945 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 and increased to $2,294 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024.\n\n4.

On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case,\nbut stated that it would reopen the case once the appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action is resolved. The lawsuit\nasserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment,\nwaste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false\nand misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking\nunspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA\u2019s corporate governance and internal procedures.\nThe putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware,\nLipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA), remain stayed pending\nresolution of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuits assert claims, purportedly on behalf\nof us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of\ninformation, corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly\nfalse, and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek\nunspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate governance\nmeasures.\nAccounting for Loss Contingencies\nAs of October 30, 2022, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based\non our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except as specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in\nthese matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of\nbusiness and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.\nNote 14 - Shareholders\u2019 Equity \nCapital Return Program \nDuring the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023, we repurchased 28 million shares for $3.65 billion and 56 million shares for\n$8.99 billion, respectively. Since the inception of our share repurchase program through October 30, 2022, we have repurchased an aggregate\nof 1.10 billion shares for $16.07 billion.

During the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2023, NVIDIA returned $3.75 billion and $9.29 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends, respectively. Additionally, as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, there was $8.28 billion remaining under the share repurchase authorization, which is valid through December 2023.",
        "reference":"In the 2022 Q3 report, NVIDIA's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were reported as $20.34 billion, with a year-over-year decrease reflecting $8.04 billion in stock repurchases, partially offset by operating cash flow generation. The company returned $99 million to shareholders in the form of cash dividends.\n\nIn the 2023 Q1 report, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities increased to $15.32 billion, up from $13.30 billion a quarter ago, primarily due to operating cash flow generation. The company continued to return cash to shareholders through dividends, paying out $99 million during the first quarter.\n\nIn the 2023 Q2 report, NVIDIA's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities further increased to $15.55 billion. The company repurchased 7.5 million shares for $3.28 billion and paid $99 million in cash dividends during the second quarter.\n\nIn the 2023 Q3 report, the cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities grew to $18.28 billion. The company repurchased 8.3 million shares for $3.72 billion and paid $99 million in dividends during the third quarter. Additionally, the company mentioned that it expects sales to China and other affected destinations to decline significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 due to new USG licensing requirements, although this decline is anticipated to be more than offset by strong growth in demand from other regions.\n\nOverall, NVIDIA's liquidity has shown an increasing trend across the quarters, with significant cash flow generation and continued return of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments. However, there is an expectation of a decline in sales to certain regions due to new export restrictions, which may impact future liquidity status and cash flows.\n\nSOURCE(S): 2022 Q3 NVDA.pdf, 2023 Q1 NVDA.pdf, 2023 Q2 NVDA.pdf, 2023 Q3 NVDA.pdf",

The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to\nchannel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also\nalleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class\ncertification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees and expert\nfees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA\u2019s motion to dismiss the\ncomplaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case.

The lawsuit alleges that NVIDIA and certain executives violated the Securities Exchange Act by making false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The district court dismissed the complaint, but the decision was partially reversed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. NVIDIA's petition for rehearing was denied by the Ninth Circuit.\n\nAdditionally, there are derivative lawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting claims against certain officers and directors for breach of fiduciary duty and other violations based on similar allegations of false and misleading statements. A new derivative action was also filed on October 30, 2023, in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware.\n\nNVIDIA has not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with these legal proceedings, based on the belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. However, the company acknowledges that any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D\ngraphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data\nscience, autonomous vehicles, robotics, metaverse and 3D internet applications.\nOur two operating segments are \"Compute & Networking\" and \"Graphics,\" as described in Note 15 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\nSupply, Products Transitions, and New Products and Business Models\nOur supply, which includes inventory on hand, purchase obligations and prepaid supply and capacity agreements, has grown significantly due to\nrecent supply chain conditions and long lead times, complexity of our products, and changes in demand. We have entered and expect to\ncontinue to enter into supplier and capacity prepayment arrangements. We have procured substantially higher Data Center supply for the\nsecond half compared to the first half of fiscal year 2024. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity\ncommitments are misaligned with demand for our products.\nProduct transitions are complex as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners\nprepare to ship and support new products. We are currently transitioning the architecture of our Data Center, Professional Visualization, and\nGaming products. Qualification time for\n23"

        "response":"NVIDIA's business faces several risk factors, including supply chain complexities, product transitions, and demand fluctuations. The company has experienced a surge in demand for its data center systems and products, leading to increased purchase obligations and the addition of new suppliers. This expansion has introduced more complexity and execution risk in the supply chain. Additionally, NVIDIA is in the process of transitioning the architecture of its Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming products, which involves managing both new and existing product lines simultaneously. This transition can be challenging due to the qualification time for new products and the anticipation of product changes by customers and channel partners. Throughout the reporting period, these factors have evolved with the company's efforts to align supply with demand and manage the complexities of product transitions.",
        "reference":"Risk factors to NVIDIA's business include:\n\n1. Demand and Supply: NVIDIA's ability to meet demand is affected by long manufacturing lead times and complex product transitions. The company faces risks in securing sufficient capacity and managing inventory levels to meet demand, which may lead to inventory provisions or impairments.\n\n2. Product Transitions: The complexity of transitioning to new product architectures can impact demand forecasting and supply mix. This includes challenges in product qualification, potential quality issues, and the timing of customer purchases.\n\n3. New Products and Business Models: NVIDIA's expansion into new use cases, applications, and services, such as AI models and cloud services, involves uncertainties in demand estimation and revenue generation.\n\n4. Global Trade: USG licensing requirements and export controls, particularly those affecting China, have impacted and may continue to impact NVIDIA's ability to sell certain products in key markets, potentially reducing revenue.\n\n5. Macroeconomic Factors: Inflation, interest rates, market volatility, and geopolitical developments can affect supply chain costs, employee wages, and the value of investments.\n\n6. Legal Proceedings: NVIDIA is involved in legal actions, including securities class action and derivative lawsuits related to alleged false or misleading statements about channel inventory and cryptocurrency mining GPU demand. The outcomes of these proceedings could impact the company's financial position.\n\nThroughout the reporting period, these risk factors have evolved, with an increased emphasis on the impact of global trade restrictions and the challenges associated with rapid growth in data center demand. NVIDIA has also highlighted the potential decline in sales to China due to new USG licensing requirements as a significant risk factor in the most recent reporting period.\n\nSOURCE(S): 2022 Q3 NVDA.pdf, 2023 Q1 NVDA.pdf, 2023 Q2 NVDA.pdf, 2023 Q3 NVDA.pdf",

The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information and we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segments. Based on theinterchangeable nature of our manufacturing and assembly and test assets, most of the related depreciation expense is not directly identifiable within our operating segments, as it isincluded in overhead cost pools and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process. Because our products are then sold acrossmultiple operating segments, it is impracticable to determine the total depreciation expense included as a component of each operating segment's operating income (loss) results. We donot allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, share-based compensation, or taxes to our operating segments. Although the CODM uses operatingincome (loss) to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments.

In general, the EC found that we violated Article 82 by offering alleged \u201cconditional rebates and payments\u201dthat required customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us and by making alleged \u201cpayments to prevent sales of specific rival products.\u201d The ECordered us to end the alleged infringement referred to in its decision and imposed a \u20ac1.1 billion fine, which we paid in the third quarter of 2009.\nWe appealed the EC decision to the European Court of Justice in 2014, after the General Court (then called the Court of First Instance) rejected our appeal of the EC decision inits entirety. In September 2017, the Court of Justice sent the case back to the General Court to examine whether the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition.\nIn January 2022, the General Court annulled the EC\u2019s 2009 findings against us regarding rebates, as well as the fine imposed on Intel, which was returned to us in February2022. In April 2022, the EC appealed the General Court\u2019s decision to the Court of Justice. A hearing date on the appeal has not been scheduled. The General Court\u2019s January2022 decision did not annul the EC\u2019s 2009 finding that we made payments to prevent sales of specific rival products, and in January 2023 the EC reopened its administrativeprocedure to determine a fine against us based on that alleged conduct. Given the procedural posture and the nature of this proceeding we are unable to make a reasonableestimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from this matter.\nIn a related matter, in April 2022 we filed applications with the General Court seeking an order requiring the EC to pay us approximately \u20ac593 million in default interest, whichapplications have been stayed pending the EC\u2019s appeal of the General Court\u2019s January 2022 decision.\nLitigation Related to Security Vulnerabilities\nIn June 2017, a Google research team notified Intel and other companies that it had identified security vulnerabilities, now commonly referred to as \u201cSpectre\u201d and \u201cMeltdown,\u201dthat affect many types of microprocessors, including our products. As is standard when findings like these are presented, we worked together with other companies in theindustry to verify the research and develop and validate software and firmware updates for impacted technologies. In January 2018, information on the security vulnerabilitieswas publicly reported, before software and firmware updates to address the vulnerabilities were made widely available.\nNumerous lawsuits have been filed against us relating to Spectre, Meltdown, and other variants of the security vulnerabilities that have been identified since 2018. As of July 26,2023, consumer class action lawsuits against us were pending in the US, Canada, and Argentina. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent various classes of purchasers of ourproducts, generally claim to have been harmed by our actions and\/or omissions in connection with the security vulnerabilities and assert a variety of common law and statutoryclaims seeking monetary damages and equitable relief. In the US, class action suits filed in various jurisdictions were consolidated for all pretrial proceedings in the US DistrictCourt for the District of Oregon, which entered final judgment in favor of Intel in July 2022 based on plaintiffs\u2019 failure to plead a viable claim. Plaintiffs have appealed that decisionto the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. In Canada, an initial status conference has not yet been scheduled in one case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Ontario, and astay of a second case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Quebec is in effect. In Argentina, Intel Argentina was served with, and responded to, a class action complaint inJune 2022. The Argentinian court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 claims for lack of standing in May 2023, and plaintiffs have appealed. Additional lawsuits and claims may be assertedseeking monetary damages or other related relief. We dispute the pending claims described above and intend to defend those lawsuits vigorously. Given the procedural postureand the nature of those cases, including that the pending proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to thelikelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we areunable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from those matters.",
            "Both petitions copied Intel's earlier petitions, and used the expert declarations previously submitted by Intel. Another entity named Patent Quality AssuranceLLC (PQA) also petitioned for IPR of certain claims of the '373 patent, those claims found to be infringed in the first Texas case judgment. PQA also largely copied Intel's petition, but (1)added a challenge to an additional claim and (2) included newly signed declarations from Intel's experts. In December 2021, the PTAB instituted OpenSky's petition on the '759 patent,but declined to institute on the '373 patent. In December 2021, Intel filed a motion to join OpenSky's '759 IPR. In January 2022, the PTAB instituted PQA's petition on the '373 patent. InFebruary, Intel filed a motion to join PQA's petition. Both of Intel's joinder motions were granted in June 2022, allowing Intel to participate in the IPRs. Hearings were held in September2022 for the OpenSky petition and in October 2022 for the PQA petition. PTAB decisions are expected in December 2022 on the '759 patent, and January 2023 on the '373 patent. Atthe same time, the Director of the United States Patent & Trademark Office is reviewing both the OpenSky and PQA IPRs to determine if they should be allowed to proceed to finalwritten decisions. The Director has said that that process may delay the final written decision of the '759 patent IPR, but has not made any similar statement regarding the timeline forthe '373 patent IPR.\nAfter consideration of the verdicts in the WDTX cases and the additional pending lawsuits filed by VLSI, Intel accrued a charge of $2.2 billion in the first quarter of 2021 and anticipateslosses, if any, in excess of this amount would be immaterial to the financial statements. We dispute VLSI\u2019s claims and intend to vigorously defend against them.\nLitigation Related to 7nm Product Delay Announcement\nStarting in July 2020, five securities class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Intel and certain current and formerofficers based on Intel\u2019s July 2020 announcement of 7nm product delays. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent classes of acquirers of Intel stock between October 2019 and July2020, generally allege that the defendants violated securities laws by making false or misleading statements about the timeline for 7nm products in light of subsequently announceddelays. In October 2020, the court consolidated the lawsuits, appointed lead plaintiffs, and in January 2021 the lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. Defendants moved todismiss the consolidated complaint in March 2021. We dispute the claims described above and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously.

We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed\nincome securities. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the\ngeographies and currencies in which they are invested.\nInterest expense was $493 million and $617 million during Q3 2021 and Q3 2022, and $1.3 billion and $1.7 billion for the nine months ended September\n30, 2021 and 2022, and was primarily related to debt and finance leases.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net was $(163) million and $759 million during Q3 2021 and Q3 2022, and $2.8 billion and $(13.4) billion for the nine months\nended September 30, 2021 and 2022. The primary components of other income (expense), net are related to equity securities valuations and adjustments, equity\nwarrant valuations, and foreign currency. Included in other income (expense), net is a marketable equity securities valuation gain (loss) of $1.1 billion in Q3\n2022, and $(10.4) billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, from our equity investment in Rivian.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was $4.2 billion, which included $1.7 billion of net discrete tax benefits\nprimarily attributable to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and audit-related developments. Our income tax benefit for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 was $2.0 billion, which included $3.3 billion of net discrete tax benefits primarily attributable to a valuation loss related to our equity\ninvestment in Rivian.

These consolidated financial statements are unaudited and, in our opinion, include all adjustments, consisting of\nnormal recurring adjustments and accruals necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated cash flows, operating results, and balance sheets for the periods\npresented. Operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for 2023 due to seasonal and other\nfactors. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) have been omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC.

All share, restricted stock unit (\u201cRSU\u201d), and per share or per RSU information throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q has been retroactively\nadjusted to reflect the stock split.

Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are\neliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates\nare used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-\nbased compensation forfeiture rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, impairment of property and equipment and operating\nleases, valuation and impairment of investments, self-insurance liabilities, and viewing patterns of capitalized video content. Actual results could differ\nmaterially from these estimates.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023, we recorded approximately $470 million of estimated severance costs primarily related to planned role\neliminations. These charges were recorded primarily in \u201cSales and marketing,\u201d \u201cTechnology and content,\u201d and \u201cGeneral and administrative\u201d on our\nconsolidated statements of operations and included approximately $270 million recorded within our AWS segment.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2023, we recorded approximately $190 million and $180 million of impairments of property and\nequipment and operating leases primarily related to physical stores in Q1 2022 and fulfillment network facilities in Q1 2023.

The weakness in foreign currencies contributed to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, which was partially offset by higher net sales of\niPad.\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, the Company announced a new iPad, a new iPad Pro powered by the Apple M2 chip, and a new Apple TV 4K.\nThe Company repurchased $19.0 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.8 billion during the first quarter of 2023.\n\u00ae\nApple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 15"

            "PART IItem 2\n \nIndustry Trends\nOur industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.\nEconomic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\nThe markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user\u2019s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talentworldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one\u2019s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.\nOur devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers, some of which contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. For these components, we have limited near-term flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. Extended disruptions at these suppliers and\/or manufacturers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2023. \nOn January 18, 2023, we announced decisions we made to align our cost structure with our revenue and customer demand, prioritize our investments in strategic areas, and consolidate office space. As a result, we recorded a $1.2 billion charge in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 (\u201cQ2 charge\u201d), which included employee severance expenses of $800 million, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. First, we reduced our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, which represents less than 5% of our total employee base. While we eliminated roles in some areas, we will continue to hire in key strategic areas. Second, we are allocating both our capital and talent to areas of secular growth and long-term competitiveness, while divesting in other areas. Third, we are consolidating our leases to create higher density across our workspaces, which will also impact our financial results through the remainder of fiscal year 2023, and we may make similar decisions in future periods as we continue to evaluate our real estate needs. \nRefer to Risk Factors (Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\nSeasonality\nOur revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second quarter revenue is drivenby corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period.\n33",

These expenses were included in general and administrative expenses and allocated to segments based on relative gross margin.\n\n2.

More recently, the EU has been developing new requirements related to the use of data, including in the Digital Markets Act, the Digital Services Act, and the Data Act, that will add additional rules and restriction on the use of data in our products and services. Engineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with these laws involve substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects. We might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under the GDPR and other data regulations, or if our implementation to comply with the GDPR makes our offerings less attractive. Compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. If we fail to comply, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply (including in response to complaints made by customers), it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in monetary penalties (of up to 4% of worldwide revenue in the case of GDPR), private lawsuits, reputational damage, blockage of international data transfers, and loss of customers. The highest fines assessed under GDPR have recently been increasing, especially against large technology companies. Jurisdictions around the world, such as China, India, and states in the U.S. have adopted, or are considering adopting or expanding, laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the collection, handling, and transfer of personal data.\nOur investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services, including AI services, we deliver to customers, to operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, and to customer perceptions of quality. Our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment. Ongoing legal analyses, reviews, and inquiries by regulators of Microsoft practices, or relevant practices of other organizations, may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements, including data sovereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location, movement, collection, and use of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. Compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate. Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity, as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort.\nWe have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes. We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. These claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as Windows, AI services, significant business transactions, warranty or product claims, employment practices, and regulation.

The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.\nOur business with government customers may present additional uncertainties. We derive substantial revenue from government contracts. Government contracts generally can present risks and challenges not present in private commercial agreements. For instance, we may be subject to government audits and investigations relating to these contracts, we could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor, we could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded. Some agreements may allow a government to terminate without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses. Some contracts may be subject to periodic funding approval, reductions, cancellations, or delays which could adversely impact public-sector demand for our products and services.

U.S. Cell Phone Litigation: Microsoft Mobile Oy, a subsidiary of Microsoft, is involved in lawsuits alleging that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused brain tumors and other adverse health effects. The outcome of these cases could potentially have a financial impact on the company if the court rules against Microsoft.\n\n2. Irish Data Protection Commission Matter: The Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) is investigating a complaint against LinkedIn regarding whether its targeted advertising practices violated the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). A preliminary draft decision by the IDPC proposed a fine, and Microsoft intends to challenge this decision. The final outcome could result in financial penalties and impact business practices.\n\n3. Activision Blizzard Acquisition: Microsoft completed the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. for $61.8 billion, net of cash acquired. The purchase price allocation is not yet complete, and most of the purchase price is expected to be allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. This acquisition could have a significant impact on Microsoft's financial statements and operations.\n\n4. Other Contingencies: Microsoft is subject to various other claims and suits that arise in the ordinary course of business. While management believes these will not have a material adverse impact on the consolidated financial statements, there is inherent uncertainty, and management's view may change in the future.\n\n5. IRS Audit and Notices of Proposed Adjustment (NOPAs): Microsoft is under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017 and has received NOPAs for tax years 2004 to 2013, seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 billion plus penalties and interest. Microsoft disagrees with the proposed adjustments and will contest the NOPAs. The resolution of these tax issues could have a material financial impact.\n\nThese legal actions and potential liabilities could influence Microsoft by affecting its financial position, resulting in monetary damages, fines, or requiring changes to business practices. The outcomes of these matters could also impact the company's reputation and future operations.\n\nSOURCE(S): 2022 Q3 MSFT.pdf, 2023 Q1 MSFT.pdf, 2023 Q2 MSFT.pdf, 2023 Q3 MSFT.pdf",

The increase in technology and infrastructure costs in absolute dollars in Q3 2023, compared to the comparable prior\nyear period, is primarily due to an increase in spending on infrastructure. The increase in technology and infrastructure costs in absolute dollars for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increased payroll and related costs associated with\ntechnical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings, and an increase in\nspending on infrastructure. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased technology and infrastructure costs by $87 million for Q3 2023, and reduced\ntechnology and infrastructure costs by $312 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. See Item 7 of Part II, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2014 Overview\u201d of our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of how management views\nadvances in technology and the importance of innovation.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales\ncommissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, social and\nonline advertising, third-party customer referrals, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales\nand changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we\nwould expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs.\nThe decrease in sales and marketing costs in absolute dollars in Q3 2023, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to lower\nmarketing spend."

        "response":"In the most recent quarter, Amazon's research and development expenditure, categorized under technology and infrastructure costs, increased in absolute dollars compared to the same period in the previous year. This increase is primarily attributed to higher spending on infrastructure and increased payroll and related costs for technical teams working on expanding existing products and services and introducing new offerings. The implications of this increased expenditure suggest a continued focus on enhancing customer experience and improving process efficiency through technological advancements, as well as supporting geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of systems and operations.",

This indicates a continued investment in innovation and technology development, which is essential for maintaining competitive advantage and driving future growth. However, the slight decrease from the previous quarter could suggest a more cautious approach possibly due to economic conditions or strategic realignment.\n\nSOURCE(S): 2023 Q3 AMZN.pdf, 2023 Q2 AMZN.pdf, 2023 Q1 AMZN.pdf, 2022 Q3 AMZN.pdf",

Amazon.com, Inc. (N.D. Ill.), alleging, among other\nthings, that Amazon\u2019s collection, storage, use, retention, and protection of biometric identifiers violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act. The\ncomplaints allege purported classes of Illinois residents who had biometric identifiers collected through Amazon products or services, including Amazon\nPhotos, Alexa, AWS cloud services, Ring, Amazon Connect, Amazon\u2019s Flex driver app, and Amazon\u2019s virtual try-on technology. The complaints seek\ncertification as class actions, unspecified amounts of damages, injunctive relief, attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and interest.

Attorneys General for the District of Columbia and California brought similar suits in May 2021 and September 2022 in the Superior Court\nof the District of Columbia and the California Superior Court for the County of San Francisco, respectively. Some of the private cases include allegations of\nseveral distinct purported classes, including consumers who purchased a product through Amazon\u2019s stores and consumers who purchased a product offered by\nAmazon through another e-commerce retailer. The complaints seek billions of dollars of alleged damages, treble damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief,\ncivil penalties, attorneys\u2019 fees, and costs. The Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) and a number of state Attorneys General filed a similar lawsuit in September\n2023 in the W.D. Wash. alleging violations of federal antitrust and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. That complaint alleges, among other things,\nthat Amazon has a monopoly in markets for online superstores and marketplace services, and unlawfully maintains those monopolies through anticompetitive\npractices relating to our pricing policies, advertising practices, the structure of Prime, and promotion of our own products on our website. The complaint seeks\ninjunctive and structural relief, an unspecified amount of damages, and costs. Amazon\u2019s motions to dismiss were granted in part and denied in part in Frame-\nWilson in March 2022 and March 2023, De Coster v. Amazon.com, Inc. (W.D. Wash.) in January 2023, and the California Attorney General\u2019s lawsuit in March\n2023. All three courts dismissed claims alleging that Amazon\u2019s pricing policies are inherently illegal and denied dismissal of claims alleging that Amazon\u2019s\npricing policies are an unlawful restraint of trade."

The sensitivity analysis indicates that a 1% additional inventory valuation allowance would have resulted in an additional cost of sales of approximately $405 million in 2022 and $375 million in 2023. This suggests that Amazon's inventory management involves significant estimation and valuation adjustments, which could reflect changes in their supply chain management strategies, such as adjustments to supplier commitments based on forecasted customer demand. The decrease in the additional cost of sales from 2022 to 2023 might indicate improvements or changes in their inventory management practices.",

Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different\nassumptions, judgments, or conditions.\nInventories\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost\nand net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such\nas through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These\nassumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-\ndowns in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of March 31, 2023, we would have recorded an\nadditional cost of sales of approximately $390 million.\nIn addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on\nforecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions."

Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company\u2019s actual results may differ significantly\nfrom the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I,Item 1A of the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022 (the \u201c2022 Form 10-K\u201d) under the heading \u201cRisk Factors.\u201dThe Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company\u2019s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months orperiods refer to the Company\u2019s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the\n\u201cCompany\u201d and \u201cApple\u201d as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2022 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) and thecondensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website,\ninvestor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and governancematters, and details related to the Company\u2019s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is notincorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company\u2019s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday\ndemand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of productintroductions can also impact the Company\u2019s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a productlaunch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers\nand distributors anticipate a product introduction.\nFiscal Period\nThe Company\u2019s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter\nevery five or six years to realign the Company\u2019s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company\u2019s fiscal years2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively.\nQuarterly Highlights\nWeakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on the Company\u2019s total net sales, which decreased 3% or $2.4 billion duringthe second quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022. The year-over-year net sales decrease consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac, partially\noffset by higher net sales of Services.\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, the Company announced the following new products:\n\u2022 MacBook Pro 14\u201d and MacBook Pro 16\u201d, powered by the Apple M2 Pro and M2 Max chip;\u2022 Mac mini, powered by the Apple M2 and M2 Pro chip; and\u2022 Second-generation HomePod.\nThe Company repurchased $19.1 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.7 billion during the second quarter of 2023.\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 14"

On September 10,2021, the District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic\u2019s claim. The District Court found that certain\nprovisions of the Company\u2019s App Store Review Guidelines violate California\u2019s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company fromprohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing.

            "PART IItem 1\n\u00a0\nNOTE 13 \u2014 CONTINGENCIES\nU.S. Cell Phone Litigation\nMicrosoft Mobile Oy, a subsidiary of Microsoft, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 46 lawsuits, including 45 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. We assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokia\u2019s Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (\u201cFCC Guidelines\u201d) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines.\nIn 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs\u2019 expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants\u2019 motion to exclude the plaintiffs\u2019 general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by thedefendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which were stricken by the court. A hearing on general causation took place in September of 2022. In April of 2023, the court granted defendants\u2019 motion to strike the testimony of plaintiffs\u2019 experts that cell phones cause brain cancer and entered an order excluding all of plaintiffs\u2019 experts from testifying. The plaintiffs appealed the court\u2019s order in August of 2023. \nIrish Data Protection Commission Matter\nIn 2018, the Irish Data Protection Commission (\u201cIDPC\u201d) began investigating a complaint against LinkedIn as to whether LinkedIn\u2019s targeted advertising practices violated the recently implemented European Union General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d). Microsoft cooperated throughout the period of inquiry. In April 2023, the IDPC provided LinkedIn with a non-public preliminary draft decision alleging GDPR violations and proposing a fine. Microsoft intends to challenge the preliminary draft decision. There is no set timeline for the IDPC to issue a final decision.\nOther Contingencies\nWe also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future.\nAs of September 30, 2023, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $597 million. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $600 million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.\nNOTE 14 \u2014 STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\nShare Repurchases\nOn September 14, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $60.0 billion in share repurchases. This share repurchase program commenced in November 2021, has no expiration date, and may be terminated at any time.

            "PART IItem 2\n \nValuation\nIn general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of ourfinancial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.\nA majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing isused mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.\nCash Flows\nCash from operations decreased $5.6 billion to $58.8 billion for the nine months ended March 31, 2023, mainly due to an increase in cash paid to employees and suppliers and cash used to pay income taxes, offset in part by an increase in cash received from customers. Cash used in financing decreased $13.1 billion to $32.5 billion for the nine months ended March 31, 2023, mainly due to a $7.4 billion decrease in common stock repurchases and a $7.3 billion decrease in repayments of debt, offset in part by a $1.2 billion increase in dividends paid. Cash used in investing decreased $7.0 billion to $13.5 billion for the nine months ended March 31, 2023, due to a $19.4 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets, offset in part by a $9.1 billion decrease in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, a $2.1 billion increase in additions to property and equipment, and a $1.2 billion increase in other investing to facilitate the purchase of components.\nDebt Proceeds\nWe issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. Refer to Note 10 \u2013 Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further discussion.\nUnearned Revenue\nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include Software Assurance (\u201cSA\u201d) and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.\n45"

The decrease in our effective tax rate for the current quarter compared to the prior year was primarily due to tax benefits from tax law changes in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, including the impact from the issuance of Notice 2023-55 by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and U.S. Treasury Department, which delayed the effective date of final foreign tax credit regulations to fiscal year 2024 for Microsoft.\nOur effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nWe remain under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017. With respect to the audit for tax years 2004 to 2013, on September 26, 2023, we received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (\u201cNOPAs\u201d) from the IRS. The primary issues in the NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 billion plus penalties and interest. As of September 30, 2023, we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will vigorously contest the NOPAs through the IRS\u2019s administrative appeals office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our income tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2023, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as dividends, share repurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and the transition tax related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTCJA\u201d), for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments\nCash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $144.0 billion and $111.3 billion as of September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively. Equity investments were $11.4 billion and $9.9 billion as of September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.\n37",

Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings and our investments in AI infrastructure. We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, Microsoft Experience Centers, and certain equipment.

            "PART IItem 2\n \nIndustry Trends\nOur industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.\nEconomic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\nThe markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user\u2019s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talentworldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one\u2019s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.\nOur devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers, some of which contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. For these components, we have limited near-term flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. Extended disruptions at these suppliers and\/or manufacturers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2023. \nOn January 18, 2023, we announced decisions we made to align our cost structure with our revenue and customer demand, prioritize our investments in strategic areas, and consolidate office space. As a result, we recorded a $1.2 billion charge in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 (\u201cQ2 charge\u201d), which included employee severance expenses of $800 million, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. First, we reduced our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, which represents less than 5% of our total employee base. While we eliminated roles in some areas, we will continue to hire in key strategic areas. Second, we are allocating both our capital and talent to areas of secular growth and long-term competitiveness, while divesting in other areas. Third, we are consolidating our leases to create higher density across our workspaces, which will also impact our financial results through the remainder of fiscal year 2023, and we may make similar decisions in future periods as we continue to evaluate our real estate needs. \nRefer to Risk Factors (Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\nSeasonality\nOur revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second quarter revenue is drivenby corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period.\n33",

In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature that are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with information included in the Microsoft Corporation fiscal year 2023 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on July 27, 2023.\nWe have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. The recast of these prior period amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated cash flows statements.\nPrinciples of Consolidation \nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. \nEstimates and Assumptions \nPreparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and\/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management\u2019s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.\nFinancial Instruments\nInvestments\nWe consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.\nDebt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive income. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. To determine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and\/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.\n8",

These costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved.

            "PART IIItem 1A\n \nBesides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. These costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. Whether we succeed in cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas, including:\n\u2022 Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share.\n\u2022 Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services on the growing array of computing devices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other devices, as well as sensors and other IoT endpoints.\n\u2022 Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers.\n\u2022 Ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data as well as help them meet their own compliance needs.\n\u2022 Making our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems, including those of our competitors.\nIt is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. If we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. This may negatively impact gross margins and operating income.\nSome users may engage in fraudulent or abusive activities through our cloud-based services.

The revenue growth reflects strong demand from large consumer\ninternet companies and cloud service providers. Enterprise demand for GPU platforms was strong, although general purpose networking\nsolutions declined both sequentially and from a year ago.\nGaming revenue was down 38% from a year ago and up 22% sequentially. The year-on-year decrease reflects weaker demand due to the\nmacroeconomic slowdown and lower shipments to normalize channel inventory levels. The sequential increase was driven by the ramp of our\nnew GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs for desktops and laptops based on the Ada Lovelace architecture.\nProfessional Visualization revenue was down 53% from a year ago and up 31% sequentially. The year-on-year decrease reflects lower sell-in to\npartners to help reduce channel inventory levels.

The year-on-year increase reflects growth in sales of self-driving\nplatforms and AI cockpit solutions.\nOEM and Other revenue was down 51% from a year ago and down 8% sequentially. These decreases were primarily driven by lower entry level\nnotebook GPU sales.\nGross margin declined from a year earlier and increased sequentially. The year-on-year decline reflects lower Gaming margins and a higher\ncontribution from Automotive, partially offset by higher Data Center margins. The sequential increase reflects lower costs in Gaming and higher\nData Center margins as we ramp our Hopper architecture.\nOperating expenses were down 30% from a year ago and down 3% sequentially. The prior year included a termination charge of $1.35 billion for\nthe proposed Arm acquisition, and the prior quarter included fixed asset write-downs.\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $15.32 billion, down from $20.34 billion a year ago and up from $13.30 billion a quarter\nago. The year-on-year decrease reflects $8.04 billion in stock repurchases, partially offset by operating cash flow generation. The sequential\nincrease reflects operating cash flow generation.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, we returned $99 million to shareholders in the form of cash dividends. As of the end of the first quarter\nof fiscal year 2024, we had $7.23 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization through December 2023.\n25",

These platforms incorporate\nprocessors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and services to deliver unique value. Our platforms address four large markets where\nour expertise is critical: Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive.\nRevenue for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $13.51 billion, up 101% from a year ago and up 88% sequentially.\nData Center revenue was up 171% from a year ago and up 141% sequentially, led by CSPs and large consumer internet companies. Strong\ndemand for the NVIDIA HGX platform based on our Hopper and Ampere GPU architectures was primarily driven by the development of large\nlanguage models and generative AI. Data Center Compute grew 195% from a year ago and 157% sequentially, largely reflecting the strong ramp\nof our Hopper-based HGX platform. Networking was up 94% from a year ago and up 85% sequentially, primarily on strong growth in InfiniBand\ninfrastructure to support our HGX platform. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, CSPs represented slightly more than half of our estimated\nData Center end demand, with large consumer internet companies being the next largest end demand, followed by enterprise and high\nperformance computing.\nGaming revenue was up 22% from a year ago and up 11% sequentially, primarily reflecting demand for our GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUsbased on the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture following normalization of channel inventory levels.\nProfessional Visualization revenue was down 24% from a year ago and up 28% sequentially. The year-on-year decrease primarily reflects lower\nsell-in to partners following normalization of channel inventory levels. The sequential increase was primarily due to stronger enterprise\nworkstation demand and the ramp of NVIDIA RTX products based on the Ada Lovelace Architecture.\nAutomotive revenue was up 15% from a year ago and down 15% sequentially. The year-on-year increase was primarily driven by sales of self-\ndriving platforms. The sequential decrease primarily reflects lower overall auto demand, particularly in China.\nGross margin increased from a year ago and sequentially, primarily reflecting growth in Data Center sales. The year-on-year increase also\nreflects the impact on the year-ago gross margin from $1.34 billion in inventory provisions and related charges.\nOperating expenses were up 10% from a year ago and up 6% sequentially, primarily driven by compensation and benefits, including stock-based\ncompensation, reflecting growth in employees and compensation increases.\nMarket Platform Highlights\nData Center revenue for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $10.32 billion, up 171% from a year ago.

Securities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits: NVIDIA is involved in a putative securities class action lawsuit alleging that the company and certain executives violated the Securities Exchange Act by making false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The lawsuit seeks class certification, unspecified compensatory damages, and other relief. Additionally, derivative lawsuits have been filed asserting claims on behalf of NVIDIA against certain officers and directors for breach of fiduciary duty and other violations based on similar allegations.\n\n2. Accounting for Loss Contingencies: As of July 30, 2023, NVIDIA has not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above, as liabilities are possible but not probable. The possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\n\n3. Purchase Obligations: NVIDIA has outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations totaling $11.15 billion as of July 30, 2023. The company has entered into supplier and capacity arrangements to meet the demand for its data center systems and products.\n\n4. Accrual for Product Warranty Liabilities: NVIDIA has estimated product warranty liabilities of $115 million as of July 30, 2023. The company recorded an inventory provision of approximately $343 million in cost of revenue for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 for inventory purchase obligations in excess of current demand projections.\n\n5. Indemnifications: NVIDIA has provided indemnities in certain agreements for matters such as tax, product, and employee liabilities, including intellectual property indemnification provisions in technology-related agreements with third parties. No maximum stated liability is typically specified, and no liability has been recorded for these indemnifications.\n\nThe impact of these legal proceedings and contingent liabilities could potentially include financial losses, increased expenses, and reputational harm. However, the ultimate outcome and potential impact on NVIDIA's financial results, liquidity, or financial position are uncertain at this time.\n\nSOURCE(S): 2023 Q2 NVDA.pdf",

Demand and Supply, Product Transitions, and New Products and Business Models: NVIDIA has increased purchase obligations to meet surging demand for data center systems and products. The complexity and execution risk associated with supply chain management may increase due to higher purchase volumes, more suppliers, and new supplier integration. Inventory provisions or impairments may occur if inventory or supply commitments exceed demand or if demand declines.\n\n2. Global Trade: The U.S. government announced licensing requirements impacting exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of NVIDIA's A100 and H100 integrated circuits, and systems or boards incorporating these circuits. Additional licensing requirements were announced for exports to certain customers and regions, including some countries in the Middle East. New licensing requirements were also announced for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 of products exceeding certain performance thresholds. These requirements are expected to significantly decline NVIDIA's sales to these destinations in Q4 of fiscal year 2024.\n\nThese risk factors are particularly notable due to their potential impact on NVIDIA's supply chain complexity, execution risk, and significant expected decline in sales to affected destinations due to new U.S. government licensing requirements.\n\nSOURCE(S): 2023 Q3 NVDA.pdf",

Another entity named Patent Quality AssuranceLLC (PQA) also petitioned for IPR of certain claims of the '373 patent, those claims found to be infringed in the first Texas case judgment. PQA also largely copied Intel's petition, but (1)added a challenge to an additional claim and (2) included newly signed declarations from Intel's experts. In December 2021, the PTAB instituted OpenSky's petition on the '759 patent,but declined to institute on the '373 patent. In December 2021, Intel filed a motion to join OpenSky's '759 IPR. In January 2022, the PTAB instituted PQA's petition on the '373 patent. InFebruary, Intel filed a motion to join PQA's petition. Both of Intel's joinder motions were granted in June 2022, allowing Intel to participate in the IPRs. Hearings were held in September2022 for the OpenSky petition and in October 2022 for the PQA petition. PTAB decisions are expected in December 2022 on the '759 patent, and January 2023 on the '373 patent. Atthe same time, the Director of the United States Patent & Trademark Office is reviewing both the OpenSky and PQA IPRs to determine if they should be allowed to proceed to finalwritten decisions. The Director has said that that process may delay the final written decision of the '759 patent IPR, but has not made any similar statement regarding the timeline forthe '373 patent IPR.\nAfter consideration of the verdicts in the WDTX cases and the additional pending lawsuits filed by VLSI, Intel accrued a charge of $2.2 billion in the first quarter of 2021 and anticipateslosses, if any, in excess of this amount would be immaterial to the financial statements. We dispute VLSI\u2019s claims and intend to vigorously defend against them.\nLitigation Related to 7nm Product Delay Announcement\nStarting in July 2020, five securities class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Intel and certain current and formerofficers based on Intel\u2019s July 2020 announcement of 7nm product delays. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent classes of acquirers of Intel stock between October 2019 and July2020, generally allege that the defendants violated securities laws by making false or misleading statements about the timeline for 7nm products in light of subsequently announceddelays. In October 2020, the court consolidated the lawsuits, appointed lead plaintiffs, and in January 2021 the lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. Defendants moved todismiss the consolidated complaint in March 2021. We dispute the claims described above and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously. Given the procedural posture and the nature ofthose cases, including that the pending proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class orclasses being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonableestimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from those matters.

        "response":"Intel's Q2 2023 10-Q reported several legal issues and potential liabilities. These include ongoing litigation related to intellectual property rights, specifically involving petitions for inter partes review (IPR) of certain patents. Intel has been involved in disputes over the '373 and '759 patents, with proceedings and decisions expected from the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB). Additionally, Intel is facing securities class action lawsuits related to the announcement of delays in their 7nm product line. These lawsuits allege that Intel made false or misleading statements about the product timeline, and the cases are still in early stages with no specified damages. Intel disputes these claims and intends to defend against them vigorously. The potential financial impact of these legal issues is uncertain, but Intel has accrued a significant charge related to the intellectual property disputes and anticipates that any additional losses would be immaterial to their financial statements.",

EC Fine Annulment: Intel reported a $1.2 billion benefit in the first six months of 2022 from the annulment of a penalty related to an EC fine that was recorded and paid in 2009. This is mentioned under \"Note 6: Restructuring and Other Charges\" in the context of litigation charges and other.\n\n2. Acquisition of Tower Semiconductor: Intel entered into an agreement to acquire Tower Semiconductor Ltd. and if regulatory approvals are not received by August 15, 2023, and the agreement is terminated by either party, Intel may be obligated to pay Tower a termination fee of $353 million. This is detailed under \"Note 9: Acquisitions and Divestitures.\"\n\n3. NAND Memory Business Divestiture: Intel is in the process of divesting its NAND memory business to SK hynix Inc. The transaction includes incentives and penalties contingent on the cost of operation and output of the NAND OpCo Business, presenting a maximum exposure of up to $500 million annually, and $1.5 billion in aggregate. Intel is currently in negotiations with SK hynix to update the operating plan, which may impact the metrics associated with the incentives and penalties. This information is also found under \"Note 9: Acquisitions and Divestitures.\"\n\nThe impact of these legal issues and potential liabilities includes financial benefits, such as the $1.2 billion benefit from the annulment of the EC fine, and potential financial obligations, such as the $353 million termination fee related to the Tower Semiconductor acquisition and the maximum exposure of $1.5 billion related to the NAND memory business divestiture.\n\nSOURCE(S): 2023 Q2 INTC.pdf",

        "response":"In Q3 2022, Intel's inventory management insights indicate that customer inventory levels were beginning to normalize, which contributed to higher notebook volumes. This suggests that Intel was experiencing a period of adjustment in inventory levels, likely aligning supply with demand more effectively. Additionally, the decrease in NEX revenue was attributed to customers tempering purchases to reduce inventories, indicating a strategic response to a lower demand environment. These points highlight the importance of inventory adjustments in response to market conditions and demand fluctuations.",

This increase could indicate that Intel is stocking up on inventory, possibly in anticipation of increased demand, supply chain uncertainties, or new product launches. The breakdown of inventory into raw materials, work in process, and finished goods is as follows:\n\n- Raw materials increased from $1,441 million to $1,635 million.\n- Work in process increased from $6,656 million to $7,030 million.\n- Finished goods increased from $2,679 million to $4,166 million.\n\nThe significant increase in finished goods could suggest that Intel has completed a higher volume of products ready for sale, which could be due to ramping up production in anticipation of market demand or experiencing slower sales than expected, leading to higher inventory levels.\n\nSOURCE(S): 2022 Q3 INTC.pdf",

Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced fulfillment costs by $396 million for Q1 2023.\nWe seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes\nfrom sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services.

These regulations and laws cover taxation, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security,\nconsumer protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, transportation, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy\nconsumption, environmental regulation, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, employment, trade and protectionist measures, web\nservices, the provision of online payment services, registration, licensing, and information reporting requirements, unencumbered Internet access to our\nservices or access to our facilities, the design and operation of websites, health, safety, and sanitation standards, the characteristics, legality, and quality of\nproducts and services, product labeling, the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems, healthcare, and other matters. It is not clear how existing laws\ngoverning issues such as property ownership, libel, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, and consumer protection\napply to aspects of our operations such as the Internet, e-commerce, digital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising, and artificial intelligence\ntechnologies and services. A large number of jurisdictions regulate our operations, and the extent, nature, and scope of such regulations is evolving and\nexpanding as the scope of our businesses expand. We are regularly subject to formal and informal reviews, investigations, and other proceedings by\ngovernments and regulatory authorities under existing laws, regulations, or interpretations or pursuing new and novel approaches to regulate our operations.\nFor example, we face a number of open investigations based on claims that aspects of our operations violate competition rules, including aspects of Amazon\u2019s\nU.S. and European marketplace for sellers, particularly with respect to use of data, fulfillment services, and featured offers, and legislative and regulatory\ninitiatives in Europe and elsewhere allow authorities to restrict or prohibit certain operations or actions pre-emptively without the need to assess specific\ncompetitive effects. Similarly, we face investigations under a growing patchwork of laws and regulations governing the collection, use, and disclosure of data,\nthe interpretation of which continues to evolve, leading to uncertainty about how regulators will view our privacy practices. Unfavorable regulations, laws,\ndecisions, or interpretations by government or regulatory authorities applying those laws and regulations, or inquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions\nthreatened or initiated by them, could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including\nsubstantial monetary fines), diminish the demand for, or availability of, our products and services, increase our cost of doing business, require us to change our\nbusiness practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, damage our reputation, impede our growth, or otherwise have a material effect on our\noperations. The media, political, and regulatory scrutiny we face, which may continue to increase, amplifies these risks.\nClaims, Litigation, Government Investigations, and Other Proceedings May Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations\nAs an innovative company offering a wide range of consumer and business products and services around the world, we are regularly subject to actual and\nthreatened claims, litigation, reviews, investigations, and other proceedings, including proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities, involving a wide\nrange of issues, including patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy, data use, data\nprotection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties,\nand other matters."

The company is subject to various claims, litigation, reviews, investigations, and other proceedings involving issues such as patent and intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, and consumer protection.

The Indian tax authority (ITA) decided that tax applies to cloud services fees paid to Amazon in the U.S. Amazon will need to remit taxes on the services in question, including for a portion of prior years, until this matter is resolved. Amazon believes the ITA's decision is without merit, is defending its position in the Indian courts, and expects to recoup taxes paid. If resolved adversely, Amazon could recognize significant additional tax expense.\n\n5. The European Commission investigated whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg complied with European Union rules on state aid. The European Commission ordered Luxembourg to recover approximately \u00e2\u201a\u00ac250 million, plus interest, from Amazon for the period May 2006 through June 2014. Luxembourg and Amazon appealed the decision. The European Union General Court annulled the decision, but the European Commission appealed to the European Court of Justice. Amazon will continue to defend itself vigorously.\n\nThese legal proceedings and potential risks could affect Amazon by potentially resulting in significant financial damages, additional tax liabilities, changes to business practices, or injunctive relief that could impact operations. The outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain and could have a material effect on Amazon's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\nSOURCE(S): 2023 Q2 AMZN.pdf",

Estimates\nare used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-\nbased compensation forfeiture rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, impairment of property and equipment and operating\nleases, valuation and impairment of investments, self-insurance liabilities, and viewing patterns of capitalized video content. Actual results could differ\nmaterially from these estimates.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023, we recorded approximately $470 million of estimated severance costs primarily related to planned role\neliminations. These charges were recorded primarily in \u201cSales and marketing,\u201d \u201cTechnology and content,\u201d and \u201cGeneral and administrative\u201d on our\nconsolidated statements of operations and included approximately $270 million recorded within our AWS segment.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2023, we recorded approximately $190 million and $180 million of impairments of property and\nequipment and operating leases primarily related to physical stores in Q1 2022 and fulfillment network facilities in Q1 2023.

The SEC\nhas defined a company\u2019s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company\u2019s financial condition and results of\noperations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that\nare inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below.

This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such\nas through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category.

        "response":"The inventory levels reported in Amazon's Q3 2022 10-Q suggest that the company is actively managing its logistics and inventory through the use of the first-in first-out method and valuing inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This approach indicates a focus on efficiently managing inventory turnover and minimizing potential losses from unsold or obsolete stock. The mention of potential material write-downs and the sensitivity analysis regarding inventory valuation allowance highlight the inherent uncertainties and challenges in predicting future inventory disposition and demand.

            "Table of Contents\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments.\nInformation relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 2 of Part I, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2014 Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our debt. Our long-term debt is carried at\namortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our long-term debt, which pays\ninterest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of\nincreasing rates of interest. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term\nmarketable debt securities. Marketable debt securities with fixed interest rates may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates,\nand we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nDuring Q3 2023, net sales from our International segment accounted for 23% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated\nfrom our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated\nin the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain\nof our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon\nconsolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains\nor losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the period compared to\nrates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales in Q3 2023 increased by $1.4 billion in comparison with Q3 2022.\nWe have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (\u201cforeign funds\u201d). Based on the balance\nof foreign funds as of September 30, 2023, of $13.7 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in declines of\n$685 million, $1.4 billion, and $2.7 billion.\nWe also have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of\nSeptember 30, 2023, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange rates would result in losses of $270 million, $545 million, and $1.1\nbillion, recorded to \u201cOther income (expense), net.\u201d\nSee Item 2 of Part I, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2014 Results of Operations \u2014 Effect of\nForeign Exchange Rates\u201d for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates.\nEquity Investment Risk\nAs of September 30, 2023, our recorded value in equity, equity warrant, and convertible debt investments in public and private companies was $9.2\nbillion. Our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies, which include our equity investment in Rivian, represent $5.7 billion of our\ninvestments as of September 30, 2023, and are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. We record our equity warrant investments in\nprivate companies at fair value and adjust our equity investments in private companies for observable price changes or impairments. Valuations of private\ncompanies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. The current global economic conditions provide additional uncertainty.\nAs such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.\n32",

Some of our current and potential competitors have greater\nresources, longer histories, more customers, and\/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer\ngeographic regions. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure,\nfulfillment, and marketing.\nCompetition continues to intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as\nour competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our\nbusiness. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices\ncontinue to increase our competition. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser\nknown businesses to compete against us. As a result of competition, our product and service offerings may not be successful, we may fail to gain or may lose\nbusiness, and we may be required to increase our spending or lower prices, any of which could materially reduce our sales and profits.\nOur Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks\nWe may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings. These offerings,\nwhich can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or\nother quality issues. In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations, and we may not be successful enough in these\nnewer activities to recoup our investments in them. Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result\nin the value of those investments being written down or written off. In addition, our sustainability initiatives may be unsuccessful for a variety of reasons,\nincluding if we are unable to realize the expected benefits of new technologies or if we do not successfully plan or execute new strategies, which could harm\nour business or damage our reputation.\nOur International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks\nOur international activities are significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In certain international market\nsegments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish,\ndevelop, and maintain international operations and stores, and promote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not become profitable on a\nsustained basis.\nIn addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022 local economic and political conditions;\n34"

The report also discusses the risks associated with equity investments, particularly the volatility in market prices and the complexities in valuing private companies. Additionally, the report mentions the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on international sales and intercompany balances.\n\nSince the last report, there is an increased emphasis on the potential adverse effects of foreign exchange rate changes, as evidenced by the detailed quantification of potential losses due to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. The report also notes the ongoing challenges posed by global economic conditions, which add uncertainty to the valuation of investments, particularly in private companies. These factors suggest a heightened awareness of the financial risks associated with international operations and market volatility.",

However, it does mention that the outcomes of legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, which could be material to Amazon's operating results and cash flows for a particular period. It also states that changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact Amazon's tax contingencies.\n\nFor specific details on any new or increased risks since the last report, one would typically compare the risk factors section of the current 10-Q with that of the previous 10-Q or 10-K filings.\n\nSOURCE(S): 2023 Q3 AMZN.pdf",

        "response":"In Apple's Q2 2023 report, the company experienced a decrease in total net sales by 3% or $2.4 billion compared to the same quarter in 2022. This decline was attributed to the unfavorable impact of weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. This indicates that Apple's revenue from international markets was negatively affected by currency fluctuations, highlighting the company's exposure to foreign currency risk. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower sales of Mac products, although this was partially offset by higher sales in the Services segment. This suggests that while Apple's international revenue is susceptible to currency fluctuations, certain segments like Services may provide some resilience against such risks.",
        "reference":"Apple's Q2 2023 report indicates that international markets are a significant component of the company's revenue. The report shows that net sales in various regions outside the United States, such as Europe, Greater China, Japan, and the Rest of Asia Pacific, collectively contribute to the company's total net sales. However, the report also highlights that the company's revenue is impacted by currency fluctuations. Specifically, it mentions that the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on the company's total net sales, which decreased by 3% during the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022.\n\nThe segment on foreign currency risk within the report discusses how Apple uses derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange risk. The company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts, or other instruments to protect its gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Apple hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. Additionally, the company may enter into derivative instruments to protect its foreign currency\u00e2\u20ac\u201cdenominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nIn summary, Apple's revenue from international markets is subject to foreign currency risk, and the company actively manages this exposure through the use of derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on its financial results.\n\nSOURCE(S): 2023 Q2 AAPL.pdf",

        "response":"The most recent 10-Q indicates that Apple's cash flow from operations decreased compared to the previous year. This decrease in cash generated by operating activities, from $98,024 million in 2022 to $88,945 million in 2023, suggests a reduction in liquidity from operational sources. Despite this, Apple still managed to increase its ending cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balance from $28,861 million in 2022 to $29,898 million in 2023. This increase was achieved through a combination of reduced cash used in investing activities and strategic financing activities, such as the issuance of term debt. These actions reflect Apple's approach to managing its liquidity and capital resources effectively, even with a decline in operational cash flow.",
        "reference":"The \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" section of Apple's most recent 10-Q report indicates that the company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents, and unrestricted marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. This suggests that the company expects to maintain a strong liquidity position.\n\nThe \"CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\" section shows that Apple's cash generated by operating activities was $88.9 billion for the nine months ended July 1, 2023. This indicates that the company's operations are generating a significant amount of cash, which supports the company's assessment in the \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" section that the cash generated from operations will contribute to meeting its cash requirements.\n\nIn summary, the insights from the \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" section correlate with the reported changes in Apple's cash flow from operations by confirming that the company's operations continue to generate substantial cash flows, which, along with its other liquid assets, are expected to cover its financial needs.\n\nSOURCE(S): 2023 Q3 AAPL.pdf",

The company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes, known as Commercial Paper, with $2.0 billion outstanding as of April 1, 2023, all payable within 12 months. This indicates a strategy to manage liquidity and meet short-term financial obligations efficiently.\n\nAdditionally, Apple utilizes derivative instruments to hedge against foreign exchange and interest rate risks associated with its debt. This includes foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps, which are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges. The notional amounts of these derivatives are substantial, reflecting Apple's proactive approach to mitigating financial risks related to its debt portfolio.\n\nOverall, Apple's debt management strategy involves balancing short-term obligations with long-term risk management through hedging, ensuring financial stability and flexibility.",
        "reference":"Apple's Q1 2023 10-Q report provides information on the company's debt instruments and management's discussion on their debt management strategy.

The report also mentions that Apple's contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2022 Form 10-K, except for commercial paper and manufacturing purchase obligations.\n\nThe report details that Apple issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (\"Commercial Paper\") under a commercial paper program, which is used for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of December 31, 2022, Apple had $1.7 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months.\n\nCombining this information, we can infer that Apple's debt management strategy involves maintaining a mix of short-term and long-term debt instruments, ensuring sufficient liquidity through a combination of cash reserves, ongoing operations, and access to debt markets, and using instruments like commercial paper for immediate corporate needs, including shareholder returns.\n\nSOURCE(S): 2023 Q1 AAPL.pdf",

However, Apple believes it would be eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision. This indicates that while there is a tax contingency that could potentially affect Apple's taxes, the company has considered the impact and believes it can mitigate some of the potential additional tax costs through U.S. foreign tax credits.\n\nThe correlation between the reported tax rate and the discussion on tax contingencies is that both reflect the impact of international tax matters on Apple's overall tax position.

At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.\nEconomic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\nThe markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user\u2019s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talentworldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one\u2019s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.\nOur devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers, some of which contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. For these components, we have limited near-term flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. Extended disruptions at these suppliers and\/or manufacturers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2023. \nOn January 18, 2023, we announced decisions we made to align our cost structure with our revenue and customer demand, prioritize our investments in strategic areas, and consolidate office space. As a result, we recorded a $1.2 billion charge in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 (\u201cQ2 charge\u201d), which included employee severance expenses of $800 million, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. First, we reduced our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, which represents less than 5% of our total employee base.

The company uses foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments to hedge foreign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated investments. Additionally, foreign exchange forward contracts are used to hedge risks related to certain Euro-denominated debt and are designated as cash flow hedging instruments.\n\nFurthermore, the report mentions that Microsoft's effective tax rate is lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing products and services through its foreign regional operations center in Ireland. This indicates that international earnings contribute significantly to Microsoft's overall financial performance and that managing currency risk is crucial to protect these earnings from the volatility of foreign exchange rates.\n\nThe use of derivative instruments to manage currency risk demonstrates the company's proactive approach to mitigating the potential adverse effects of currency fluctuations on its international earnings, which are a substantial part of its revenue.\n\nSOURCE(S): 2023 Q2 MSFT.pdf",

Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies reduced reported revenue and expenses from our internationaloperations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022.\nOn January 18, 2023, we announced decisions we made to align our cost structure with our revenue and customer demand, prioritize ourinvestments in strategic areas, and consolidate office space. As a result, we recorded a $1.2 billion charge in the second quarter of fiscalyear 2023 (\u201cQ2 charge\u201d), which included employee severance expenses of $800 million, impairment charges resulting from changes to ourhardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. First, we are reducing our overall workforce by approximately 10,000jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, which represents less than 5% of our total employee base. While we are eliminating roles insome areas, we will continue to hire in key strategic areas. Second, we are allocating both our capital and talent to areas of secular growthand long-term competitiveness, while divesting in other areas. Third, we are consolidating our leases to create higher density across ourworkspaces, which will also impact our financial results through the remainder of fiscal year 2023, and we may make similar decisions infuture periods as we continue to evaluate our real estate needs.\nRefer to Risk Factors (Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\nSeasonality\nOur revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second quarter revenue is drivenby corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue isdriven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period.\n32"

In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature that are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with information included in the Microsoft Corporation fiscal year 2023 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on July 27, 2023.\nWe have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. The recast of these prior period amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated cash flows statements.\nPrinciples of Consolidation \nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. \nEstimates and Assumptions \nPreparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and\/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management\u2019s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.\nFinancial Instruments\nInvestments\nWe consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.\nDebt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive income. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. To determine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and\/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.\n8",
            "PART IItem 1\n\u00a0\nNOTE 13 \u2014 CONTINGENCIES\nU.S. Cell Phone Litigation\nMicrosoft Mobile Oy, a subsidiary of Microsoft, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 46 lawsuits, including 45 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. We assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokia\u2019s Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (\u201cFCC Guidelines\u201d) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines.\nIn 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs\u2019 expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants\u2019 motion to exclude the plaintiffs\u2019 general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by thedefendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which were stricken by the court. A hearing on general causation took place in September of 2022. In April of 2023, the court granted defendants\u2019 motion to strike the testimony of plaintiffs\u2019 experts that cell phones cause brain cancer and entered an order excluding all of plaintiffs\u2019 experts from testifying. The plaintiffs appealed the court\u2019s order in August of 2023. \nIrish Data Protection Commission Matter\nIn 2018, the Irish Data Protection Commission (\u201cIDPC\u201d) began investigating a complaint against LinkedIn as to whether LinkedIn\u2019s targeted advertising practices violated the recently implemented European Union General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d). Microsoft cooperated throughout the period of inquiry. In April 2023, the IDPC provided LinkedIn with a non-public preliminary draft decision alleging GDPR violations and proposing a fine. Microsoft intends to challenge the preliminary draft decision. There is no set timeline for the IDPC to issue a final decision.\nOther Contingencies\nWe also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future.\nAs of September 30, 2023, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $597 million. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $600 million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.\nNOTE 14 \u2014 STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\nShare Repurchases\nOn September 14, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $60.0 billion in share repurchases. This share repurchase program commenced in November 2021, has no expiration date, and may be terminated at any time.

            "PART IItem 2\n \nOTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET\nThe components of other income (expense), net were as follows: \n(In millions)                     \nThree Months Ended September 30,  2022  2021        \nInterest and dividends income  $ 641  $ 520  Interest expense     (500)    (539) Net recognized gains on investments   13   371  Net gains (losses) on derivatives   9   (7) Net losses on foreign currency remeasurements   (78)  (65) Other, net   (31)  6  \n                    \nTotal  $ 54  $ 286  \n          \n \nWe use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; enhance investmentreturns; and facilitate portfolio diversification. Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedginginstruments are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2022 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2021\nInterest and dividends income increased due to higher yields, offset in part by lower portfolio balances. Interest expense decreased due to adecrease in outstanding long-term debt due to debt maturities. Net recognized gains on investments decreased primarily due to lower gainson equity securities.\nINCOME TAXES\nEffective Tax Rate\nOur effective tax rate was 19% and 0% for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in our effectivetax rate for the current quarter compared to the prior year was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscalyear 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties and a decrease in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the U.S. The transfer ofintangible properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future U.S. taxdeductions exceeded the current tax liability from the U.S. global intangible low-taxed income tax.\nOur effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate for the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due toearnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreignregional operations center in Ireland.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nWe settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In February 2012, the IRSwithdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of theexamination. We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for taxyears 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the IRS audits for taxyears 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of $1.7 billion, including tax and interest. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact inour consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate.We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues and do not expect a final resolution of theseissues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our taxcontingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.\n38",
            "PART IItem 2\n\u00a0\nINCOME TAXES\nEffective Tax Rate\nOur effective tax rate was 18% and 19% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the current quarter compared to the prior year was primarily due to tax benefits from tax law changes in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, including the impact from the issuance of Notice 2023-55 by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and U.S. Treasury Department, which delayed the effective date of final foreign tax credit regulations to fiscal year 2024 for Microsoft.\nOur effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nWe remain under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017. With respect to the audit for tax years 2004 to 2013, on September 26, 2023, we received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (\u201cNOPAs\u201d) from the IRS. The primary issues in the NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 billion plus penalties and interest. As of September 30, 2023, we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will vigorously contest the NOPAs through the IRS\u2019s administrative appeals office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our income tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2023, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as dividends, share repurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and the transition tax related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTCJA\u201d), for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments\nCash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $144.0 billion and $111.3 billion as of September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively. Equity investments were $11.4 billion and $9.9 billion as of September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.\n37"

Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and\/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management\u2019s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.\nFinancial Instruments\nInvestments\nWe consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.\nDebt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive income. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. To determine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and\/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.\n8",
            "PART IItem 1\n \nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n(Unaudited) \n \nNOTE 1 \u2014 ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nAccounting Principles \nOur unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d). In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature that are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with information included in the Microsoft Corporation fiscal year 2022 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on July 28, 2022.\nPrinciples of Consolidation \nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. \nEstimates and Assumptions \nPreparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price (\u201cSSP\u201d) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and\/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management\u2019s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was an increase in operating income of $885 million and net income of $720 million, or $0.10 per both basic and diluted share. The effect of this change for the nine months ended March 31, 2023 was an increase in operating income of $2.9 billion and net income of $2.3 billion, or $0.32 and $0.31 per basic and diluted share, respectively.\nFinancial Instruments\nInvestments\nWe consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.\n8"

These platforms incorporate\nprocessors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and services to deliver unique value. Our platforms address four large markets where\nour expertise is critical: Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive.\nRevenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $7.19 billion, down 13% from a year ago and up 19% sequentially.\nData Center revenue was up 14% from a year ago and up 18% sequentially, led by growing demand for generative AI and large language\nmodels using GPUs based on our NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. The revenue growth reflects strong demand from large consumer\ninternet companies and cloud service providers. Enterprise demand for GPU platforms was strong, although general purpose networking\nsolutions declined both sequentially and from a year ago.\nGaming revenue was down 38% from a year ago and up 22% sequentially. The year-on-year decrease reflects weaker demand due to the\nmacroeconomic slowdown and lower shipments to normalize channel inventory levels. The sequential increase was driven by the ramp of our\nnew GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs for desktops and laptops based on the Ada Lovelace architecture.\nProfessional Visualization revenue was down 53% from a year ago and up 31% sequentially. The year-on-year decrease reflects lower sell-in to\npartners to help reduce channel inventory levels. The sequential increase was driven by higher demand for desktop and mobile workstation\nGPUs.\nAutomotive revenue was up 114% from a year ago and up 1% sequentially. The year-on-year increase reflects growth in sales of self-driving\nplatforms and AI cockpit solutions.\nOEM and Other revenue was down 51% from a year ago and down 8% sequentially. These decreases were primarily driven by lower entry level\nnotebook GPU sales.\nGross margin declined from a year earlier and increased sequentially. The year-on-year decline reflects lower Gaming margins and a higher\ncontribution from Automotive, partially offset by higher Data Center margins. The sequential increase reflects lower costs in Gaming and higher\nData Center margins as we ramp our Hopper architecture.\nOperating expenses were down 30% from a year ago and down 3% sequentially. The prior year included a termination charge of $1.35 billion for\nthe proposed Arm acquisition, and the prior quarter included fixed asset write-downs.\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $15.32 billion, down from $20.34 billion a year ago and up from $13.30 billion a quarter\nago. The year-on-year decrease reflects $8.04 billion in stock repurchases, partially offset by operating cash flow generation. The sequential\nincrease reflects operating cash flow generation.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, we returned $99 million to shareholders in the form of cash dividends. As of the end of the first quarter\nof fiscal year 2024, we had $7.23 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization through December 2023.\n25"

Since our original focus on PC graphics,\nwe have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D\ngraphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data\nscience, autonomous vehicles, robotics, metaverse and 3D internet applications.\nOur two operating segments are \"Compute & Networking\" and \"Graphics,\" as described in Note 15 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\nSupply, Products Transitions, and New Products and Business Models\nOur supply, which includes inventory on hand, purchase obligations and prepaid supply and capacity agreements, has grown significantly due to\nrecent supply chain conditions and long lead times, complexity of our products, and changes in demand. We have entered and expect to\ncontinue to enter into supplier and capacity prepayment arrangements. We have procured substantially higher Data Center supply for the\nsecond half compared to the first half of fiscal year 2024. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity\ncommitments are misaligned with demand for our products.\nProduct transitions are complex as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners\nprepare to ship and support new products.

        "response":"The Q3 2023 10-Q report from NVIDIA highlights a significant increase in demand for their data center systems and products, which has led to an expansion in their supply chain strategies. To meet this demand, NVIDIA has increased purchase obligations with existing suppliers, added new suppliers, and entered into prepaid supply and capacity agreements. This approach is intended to ensure a steady supply of products, but it also introduces more complexity and execution risk into their supply chain. As a result, there is a potential risk of inventory provisions or impairments if their inventory or supply commitments exceed actual demand. This strategy reflects a proactive approach to managing supply chain challenges and ensuring product availability, but it also requires careful management to avoid excess inventory.",
        "reference":"In NVIDIA's Q3 2023 10-Q, the reported changes in inventory levels indicate an increase in purchase obligations and the entry into prepaid supply and capacity agreements to meet the surge in demand for data center systems and products. The inventory at the end of Q3 2023 was $4,779 million, compared to $5,159 million at the end of the fiscal year 2023, as detailed in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (Note 14 - Balance Sheet Components).\n\nThe supply chain and logistics strategies discussed in the report include increasing purchase obligations with existing suppliers, adding new suppliers, and entering into prepaid supply and capacity agreements. These strategies are aimed at meeting the expected demand, which has surged over the last three quarters and for which demand visibility extends into the next year. NVIDIA expects to continue entering into supplier and capacity arrangements and anticipates supply to increase each quarter through the next year. The company acknowledges the increased complexity and execution risk associated with these strategies, including the integration of new suppliers into the supply chain.\n\nAdditionally, the report mentions the challenges associated with managing supply and demand due to long manufacturing lead times, product transitions, and the introduction of new products. NVIDIA builds finished products and maintains inventory in advance of anticipated demand, which may lead to inventory provisions or impairments if inventory or supply commitments exceed demand or if demand declines.\n\nSOURCE(S): 2023 Q3 NVDA.pdf",

The revenue growth reflects strong demand from large consumer\ninternet companies and cloud service providers. Enterprise demand for GPU platforms was strong, although general purpose networking\nsolutions declined both sequentially and from a year ago.\nGaming revenue was down 38% from a year ago and up 22% sequentially. The year-on-year decrease reflects weaker demand due to the\nmacroeconomic slowdown and lower shipments to normalize channel inventory levels. The sequential increase was driven by the ramp of our\nnew GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs for desktops and laptops based on the Ada Lovelace architecture.\nProfessional Visualization revenue was down 53% from a year ago and up 31% sequentially. The year-on-year decrease reflects lower sell-in to\npartners to help reduce channel inventory levels. The sequential increase was driven by higher demand for desktop and mobile workstation\nGPUs.\nAutomotive revenue was up 114% from a year ago and up 1% sequentially. The year-on-year increase reflects growth in sales of self-driving\nplatforms and AI cockpit solutions.\nOEM and Other revenue was down 51% from a year ago and down 8% sequentially. These decreases were primarily driven by lower entry level\nnotebook GPU sales.\nGross margin declined from a year earlier and increased sequentially. The year-on-year decline reflects lower Gaming margins and a higher\ncontribution from Automotive, partially offset by higher Data Center margins. The sequential increase reflects lower costs in Gaming and higher\nData Center margins as we ramp our Hopper architecture.\nOperating expenses were down 30% from a year ago and down 3% sequentially. The prior year included a termination charge of $1.35 billion for\nthe proposed Arm acquisition, and the prior quarter included fixed asset write-downs.\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $15.32 billion, down from $20.34 billion a year ago and up from $13.30 billion a quarter\nago. The year-on-year decrease reflects $8.04 billion in stock repurchases, partially offset by operating cash flow generation. The sequential\nincrease reflects operating cash flow generation.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, we returned $99 million to shareholders in the form of cash dividends.

Strong sales of the NVIDIA HGX platform were driven by global\ndemand for the training and inferencing of large language models, recommendation engines, and generative AI applications. Data Center\ncompute grew 324% from a year ago and 38% sequentially, largely reflecting the strong ramp of our Hopper GPU architecture-based HGX\nplatform from cloud service providers, or CSPs, including GPU-specialized CSPs; consumer internet companies; and enterprises. Our sales of\nAmpere GPU architecture-based Data Center products were significant but declined sequentially, as we approach the tail end of this\narchitecture. We recognized initial revenue on the ramp of our L40S GPU and the GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip for a broad range of\ncustomers. CSPs drove roughly half of Data Center revenue, while consumer internet companies and enterprises comprised approximately the\nother half. Networking was up 155% from a year ago and up 52% sequentially, almost entirely due to strong growth in InfiniBand infrastructure to\nsupport our HGX platform.\nGaming revenue was up 81% from a year ago and up 15% sequentially. Strong year-on-year growth reflects higher sell-in to partners following\nnormalization of channel inventory levels. Sequential growth reflects strong demand for our GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs for back-to-school\nand the start of the holiday season.\nProfessional Visualization revenue was up 108% from a year ago and up 10% sequentially. The year-on-year increase reflects higher sell-in to\npartners following normalization of channel inventory levels. The sequential increase was primarily due to stronger enterprise workstation\ndemand and the ramp of notebook workstations based on the Ada Lovelace GPU architecture.\nAutomotive revenue was up 4% from a year ago and up 3% sequentially. The year-on-year increase primarily reflects growth in sales of auto\ncockpit solutions and self-driving platforms. The sequential increase was driven by sales of self-driving platforms.\nGross margin increased significantly from a year ago and sequentially, driven by improved product mix from Data Center revenue growth and\nlower net inventory provisions and related charges.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, provisions for inventory and related charges were $681 million. Sales of previously reserved inventory or\nsettlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $239 million, primarily from Ampere GPU architecture\nproducts.

The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information and we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segments. Based on theinterchangeable nature of our manufacturing and assembly and test assets, most of the related depreciation expense is not directly identifiable within our operating segments, as it isincluded in overhead cost pools and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process. Because our products are then sold acrossmultiple operating segments, it is impracticable to determine the total depreciation expense included as a component of each operating segment's operating income (loss) results. We donot allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, share-based compensation, or taxes to our operating segments.

            "Table of Contents\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments.\nInformation relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 2 of Part I, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2014 Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our debt. Our long-term debt is carried at\namortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our long-term debt, which pays\ninterest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of\nincreasing rates of interest. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term\nmarketable debt securities. Marketable debt securities with fixed interest rates may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates,\nand we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nDuring Q2 2023, net sales from our International segment accounted for 22% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated\nfrom our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated\nin the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain\nof our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon\nconsolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains\nor losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances.

            "Table of Contents\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments.\nInformation relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 2 of Part I, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2014 Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our debt. Our long-term debt is carried at\namortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our long-term debt, which pays\ninterest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of\nincreasing rates of interest. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed\nincome securities. Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in\nprincipal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nDuring Q1 2023, net sales from our International segment accounted for 23% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated\nfrom our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated\nin the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain\nof our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon\nconsolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains\nor losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the period compared to\nrates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales in Q1 2023 decreased by $2.3 billion in comparison with Q1 2022.\nWe have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (\u201cforeign funds\u201d). Based on the balance\nof foreign funds as of March 31, 2023, of $13.3 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in declines of $665\nmillion, $1.3 billion, and $2.7 billion.\nWe also have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of\nMarch 31, 2023, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange rates would result in losses of $245 million, $490 million, and $985\nmillion, recorded to \u201cOther income (expense), net.\u201d\nSee Item 2 of Part I, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2014 Results of Operations \u2014 Effect of\nForeign Exchange Rates\u201d for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates.\nEquity Investment Risk\nAs of March 31, 2023, our recorded value in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was $6.7 billion. Our equity and\nequity warrant investments in publicly traded companies, which primarily relate to Rivian, represent $4.4 billion of our investments as of March 31, 2023, and\nare recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. We record our equity warrant investments in private companies at fair value and adjust our\nequity investments in private companies for observable price changes or impairments. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the\nlack of readily available market data. The current global economic conditions provide additional uncertainty. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are\nnot practicable.\n33"

The report states that the company has recognized gains and losses on these contracts in other comprehensive income (loss) and that these hedges are intended to mitigate the risk of currency exchange rate movements on cash flows.

Additionally, the adjusted free cash flow was negative, at $(10,548) million, compared to $(7,139) million in 2022, reflecting higher net additions to property, plant, and equipment and payments on finance leases.

            "Table of Contents\nThe CODM, who is our CEO, allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about the operating segment's revenue and operatingincome (loss). The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information and we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segments. Based on theinterchangeable nature of our manufacturing and assembly and test assets, most of the related depreciation expense is not directly identifiable within our operating segments, as it isincluded in overhead cost pools and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process. Because our products are then sold acrossmultiple operating segments, it is impracticable to determine the total depreciation expense included as a component of each operating segment's operating income (loss) results. We donot allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, share-based compensation, or taxes to our operating segments. Although the CODM uses operatingincome (loss) to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for Intel asa whole.

While Intel Optane is a leadingtechnology, it was not aligned to our strategic priorities. Separately, we continue to embrace the CXL standard. As a result, we recognized an inventory impairment of $559 million inCost of sales on the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income in the first nine months of 2022.

Additionally, sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and related transaction costs as a percentage of net sales\ncompared to our retail sales because payment processing costs are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions.\nThe increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in Q1 2023, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increased sales,\npartially offset by fulfillment network efficiencies. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced fulfillment costs by $396 million for Q1 2023.\nWe seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes\nfrom sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.\nTechnology and Content\nTechnology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products\nand services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and\ninfrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other\nexpenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of\nproducts and services to our customers, including expenditures related to initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices\nand the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services.\nWe seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our\nprocess efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital\nspending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and\noperations. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. These costs are\nallocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in Q1 2023, compared to the comparable prior year\nperiod, is primarily due to increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and\ninitiatives to introduce new products and service offerings, and an increase in spending on technology infrastructure. Changes in foreign exchange rates\nreduced technology and content costs by $304 million for Q1 2023.

We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, social and\nonline advertising, third-party customer referrals, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales\nand changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we\nwould expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs.\nThe increase in sales and marketing costs in absolute dollars in Q1 2023, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increased\npayroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities.\nWhile costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in sales and marketing expense, we view\nthese offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely.\nGeneral and Administrative\nThe increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in Q1 2023, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to an\nincrease in payroll and related expenses.\n28",

The report highlights that inventory management involves making judgments about the likely method of disposition and expected recoverable values, which are inherently uncertain. This suggests that Amazon's supply chain management strategies are focused on optimizing inventory levels to minimize potential write-downs and additional costs. The sensitivity analysis provided, which shows the impact of a 1% change in inventory valuation allowance, underscores the importance of precise inventory management in their overall strategy. Additionally, supplier commitments based on forecasted customer demand are part of their strategy to manage supply chain risks and costs effectively.",

            "Table of Contents\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments.\nInformation relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 2 of Part I, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2014 Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. Our long-term debt is\ncarried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays\ninterest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of\nincreasing rates of interest. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed\nincome securities. Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in\nprincipal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nDuring Q3 2022, net sales from our International segment accounted for 22% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated\nfrom our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated\nin the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain\nof our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon\nconsolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains\nor losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the period compared to\nrates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales in Q3 2022 decreased by $4.9 billion in comparison with Q3 2021.\nWe have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (\u201cforeign funds\u201d). Based on the balance\nof foreign funds as of September 30, 2022, of $11.6 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in declines of\n$580 million, $1.2 billion, and $2.3 billion.\nWe also have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of\nSeptember 30, 2022, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange rates would result in losses of $405 million, $810 million, and $1.6\nbillion, recorded to \u201cOther income (expense), net.\u201d\nSee Item 2 of Part I, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2014 Results of Operations \u2014 Effect of\nForeign Exchange Rates\u201d for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates.\nEquity Investment Risk\nAs of September 30, 2022, our recorded value in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was $10.1 billion. Our equity\nand equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies, which primarily relate to Rivian, represent $7.8 billion of our investments as of September 30,\n2022, and are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. We record our equity warrant investments in private companies at fair value and\nadjust our equity investments in private companies for observable price changes or impairments. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex\ndue to the lack of readily available market data. The current global economic conditions provide additional uncertainty. As such, we believe that market\nsensitivities are not practicable.\n32",

Risk Factors\nPlease carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky. The\nevents and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results),\ncash flows, liquidity, and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or\nuncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. In addition to the factors\ndiscussed in Item 2 of Part I, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d and in the risk factors below, global\neconomic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of the risks\ndiscussed below. Many of the risks discussed below also impact our customers, including third-party sellers, which could indirectly have a material adverse\neffect on us.\nBusiness and Industry Risks\nWe Face Intense Competition\nOur businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors across geographies, including cross-border competition,\nand in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-commerce services, web and infrastructure computing services,\nelectronic devices, digital content, advertising, grocery, and transportation and logistics services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater\nresources, longer histories, more customers, and\/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer\ngeographic regions. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure,\nfulfillment, and marketing.\nCompetition continues to intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as\nour competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our\nbusiness. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, practical applications of artificial\nintelligence and machine learning, digital content, and electronic devices continue to increase our competition. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and\ncomparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser known businesses to compete against us. As a result of competition, our product and\nservice offerings may not be successful, we may fail to gain or may lose business, and we may be required to increase our spending or lower prices, any of\nwhich could materially reduce our sales and profits.\nOur Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks\nWe may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings. These offerings,\nwhich can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience, or are otherwise impacted by,\nservice disruptions, delays, setbacks, or failures or quality issues. In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations, and we\nmay not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them, which investments are often significant. Failure to realize the\nbenefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the value of those investments being written down or written off. In\naddition, our sustainability initiatives may be unsuccessful for a variety of reasons, including if we are unable to realize the expected benefits of new\ntechnologies or if we do not successfully plan or execute new strategies, which could harm our business or damage our reputation.\nOur International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks\nOur international activities are significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In certain international market\nsegments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish,\ndevelop, and maintain international operations and stores, and promote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not become profitable on a\nsustained basis.\n34"

            "Table of Contents\nNote 7 \u2014 INCOME TAXES\nOur tax provision or benefit from income taxes for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete\nitems, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period. Each quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if our estimated tax rate\nchanges, we make a cumulative adjustment.\nOur quarterly tax provision, and our quarterly estimate of our annual effective tax rate, is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including\nvariability in accurately predicting our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the\napplicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, developments in tax controversies, changes in our stock price,\nchanges in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and\nadministrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and\naccounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Our effective tax rate can be\nmore or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax\nrate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. In addition, we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when there is uncertainty about our\nability to generate future income in relevant jurisdictions.\nFor 2023, we estimate that our effective tax rate will be favorably impacted by the foreign income deduction and U.S. federal research and development\ncredit and adversely affected by state income taxes. In addition, valuation gains and losses from our equity investment in Rivian impact our pre-tax income and\nmay cause variability in our effective tax rate.\nOur income tax benefit for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was $1.4 billion, which included $2.1 billion of net discrete tax benefits primarily\nattributable to a valuation loss related to our equity investment in Rivian. Our income tax provision for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $948\nmillion, which included $48 million of net discrete tax expense.\nCash paid for income taxes, net of refunds was $453 million and $619 million in Q1 2022 and Q1 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023, tax contingencies were approximately $4.0 billion and $4.2 billion. Changes in tax laws, regulations,\nadministrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact our tax contingencies. Due to various factors, including the inherent complexities and\nuncertainties of the judicial, administrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the timing of the resolution of income tax controversies is highly\nuncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is\nreasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income\ntax controversies in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years\u2019\ntax filings.\nWe are under examination, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service for the calendar year 2016 and thereafter.

We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular\njurisdictions primarily for 2011 and thereafter.

Each quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if our estimated tax rate\nchanges, we make a cumulative adjustment.\nOur quarterly tax provision, and our quarterly estimate of our annual effective tax rate, is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including\nvariability in accurately predicting our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the\napplicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, developments in tax controversies, changes in our stock price,\nchanges in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and\nadministrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and\naccounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Our effective tax rate can be\nmore or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax\nrate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. In addition, we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when there is uncertainty about our\nability to generate future income in relevant jurisdictions.\nFor 2022, we estimate that our effective tax rate will be favorably impacted by the U.S. federal research and development credit. In addition, valuation\ngains and losses from our equity investment in Rivian impact our pre-tax income and may cause variability in our effective tax rate.\n17"

        "response":"Amazon's effective tax rate for the most recent period is influenced by several factors, as discussed in the notes section. The company estimates that its effective tax rate for 2023 will benefit from the foreign income deduction and the U.S. federal research and development credit, while being negatively impacted by state income taxes. Additionally, valuation gains and losses from its equity investment in Rivian are expected to affect pre-tax income and contribute to variability in the effective tax rate. The notes also highlight that the effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to factors such as changes in pre-tax income, intercompany transactions, and developments in tax controversies. This variability is further compounded by the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses, which have a greater effect when pre-tax income is lower.

This resulted in an income tax provision of $4.1 billion.\n\nIn the notes section, specifically in Note 7 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d INCOME TAXES, it is mentioned that Amazon's tax provision or benefit from income taxes for interim periods is determined using an estimate of the annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items. The note also states that the quarterly tax provision and the estimate of the annual effective tax rate are subject to significant variation due to several factors, including the variability in predicting pre-tax and taxable income and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate. Additionally, the note discusses various factors that could impact the effective tax rate, such as changes in global economic conditions, customer demand, competition, management of growth, and potential fluctuations in operating results.\n\nThe notes section also details ongoing tax disputes and contingencies, including disputes with the Luxembourg tax authority (LTA) and the Indian tax authority (ITA), as well as the European Commission's investigation into whether tax decisions by the Luxembourg tax authorities comply with European Union rules on state aid.\n\nOverall, the effective tax rate reported reflects the outcomes of various factors, including business operations, discrete items, and ongoing tax disputes, as discussed in the notes section.\n\nSOURCE(S): 2023 Q3 AMZN.pdf",
