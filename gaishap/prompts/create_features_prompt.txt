The following are the questions for you to process:

## Input:

[QUESION 1] The pilot’s failure to maintain adequate clearance from a fence during takeoff.
[QUESION 2] The pilot’s failure to maintain airplane control after an engine access cover opened during the initial climb.
[QUESION 3] An in-flight collision with multiple geese during initial climb.
[QUESION 4] The pilot’s inadequate compensation for prevailing wind conditions during the landing approach, which resulted in the airplane contacting the ground short of the runway.
[QUESION 5] The pilot’s failure to properly set the rudder trim position which resulted in a loss of directional control during takeoff. Contributing was the pilot’s inadequate checklist procedures prior to takeoff.
[QUESION 6] Oil starvation of the propeller speed reduction unit which resulted in a total loss of engine power.
[QUESION 7] The flight instructor’s inadequate supervision of the landing approach and go-around, and his delayed remedial action.
[QUESION 8] The pilot’s failure to ensure adequate airplane performance before taking off from a significantly shorter runway than originally planned for.
[QUESION 9] The student pilot’s failure to maintain directional control during landing and the subsequent go-around, which resulted in impact with a hangar.
[QUESION 10] The student pilot’s failure to maintain helicopter control while on the ground when his attention was diverted for post flight activities.
[QUESION 11] The instructor’s failure to maintain airspeed during a simulated turning autorotation, which resulted in a hard landing.
[QUESION 12] The pilot’s failure to maintain control of the helicopter during a hover taxi, which resulted in a rollover.
[QUESION 13] The pilot’s failure to maintain directional control during landing with a quartering tailwind, which resulted in a runway excursion and nose over.
[QUESION 14] The pilot's loss of directional control during takeoff and subsequent excessive use of brakes which resulted in a nose-over.  Contributing to the accident was his decision to takeoff downwind.
[QUESION 15] The pilot’s failure to maintain airspeed resulting in exceeding the airplane’s critical angle of attack and an aerodynamic stall. The low altitude at which the flight was conducted contributed to the outcome.
[QUESION 16] The pilot’s failure to maintain directional control in gusting wind conditions.
[QUESION 17] The flight instructor’s failure to properly configure the wing flaps for a soft-field takeoff on a short runway, which resulted in a runway overrun and collision with trees.
[QUESION 18] The pilot’s failure to attain the proper touchdown speed, which resulted in a runway excursion and subsequent nose over.
[QUESION 19] The pilot’s improper selection of a touchdown point and delayed recognition, which resulted in an impact with an obstacle.
[QUESION 20] Fuel exhaustion due to the pilot’s inadequate preflight planning.
[QUESION 21] The pilot’s improper landing flare, which resulted in a hard landing and the left main landing gear collapse.
[QUESION 22] The pilot’s improper anti-torque pedal inputs during takeoff, which resulted in a loss of helicopter control during takeoff and subsequent dynamic rollover.
[QUESION 23] An encounter with a downdraft during landing that resulted in the pilot’s loss of control.As stated above, the initial PC was not incorrect, but it didn’t paint an accurate picture of what really happened.
[QUESION 24] The pilot’s failure to maintain clearance from terrain while maneuvering at low attitude.
[QUESION 25] The pilot exceeding the climb capability of the airplane during takeoff which led to it settling into the ground.
[QUESION 26] The pilot’s failure to maintain directional control of the airplane while landing in a crosswind.
[QUESION 27] The pilot’s improper landing flare and subsequent improper recovery from a bounced landing which resulted in a nose over.
