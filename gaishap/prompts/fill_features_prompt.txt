[QUESION 6] Oil starvation of the propeller speed reduction unit which resulted in a total loss of engine power.
[QUESION 7] The flight instructor’s inadequate supervision of the landing approach and go-around, and his delayed remedial action.
[QUESION 8] The pilot’s failure to ensure adequate airplane performance before taking off from a significantly shorter runway than originally planned for.
[QUESION 9] The student pilot’s failure to maintain directional control during landing and the subsequent go-around, which resulted in impact with a hangar.
[QUESION 10] The student pilot’s failure to maintain helicopter control while on the ground when his attention was diverted for post flight activities.
[QUESION 11] The instructor’s failure to maintain airspeed during a simulated turning autorotation, which resulted in a hard landing.
